# 🤖 LLM-Enhanced PR Analysis

## 🎯 LLM-Enhanced Analysis Made Standard!

We've successfully implemented LLM-enhanced analysis as the standard approach for all PR evaluations, providing intelligent insights for every code change.

## 📊 Intelligence Levels

### 🧠 Smart Mode (Default)
- **LLM-enhanced breaking change detection**
- **Intelligent coordination recommendations**
- **Seconds execution, minimal token usage**
- **Perfect for**: Complex PRs, coordination-sensitive changes

```python
git_analyzer(
    base_branch="main",
    feature_branch="feature/subfeatureB",
    compare_branches=["feature/subfeatureA", "mobile/F1"], 
    intelligence_level="smart"  # Default
)
```

### 🧪 Deep Mode
- **Comprehensive LLM analysis with business impact**
- **Coordination planning and stakeholder mapping**
- **Minutes execution, higher token usage**
- **Perfect for**: Critical releases, major architectural changes

```python
git_analyzer(
    base_branch="main",
    feature_branch="feature/subfeatureB",
    compare_branches=["feature/subfeatureA", "mobile/F1"],
    intelligence_level="deep"
)
```

## 🎣 What LLM Enhancement Adds

### 📈 git_analyzer Enhancements:

#### Smart Mode:
- **🔍 Breaking Change Detection**:
  ```json
  {
    "breaking_changes": [
      {
        "file": "src/api/auth.py",
        "description": "Function signature changed from login(email, password) to login(credentials)",
        "severity": "high"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- **🤝 Coordination Requirements**:
  ```json
  {
    "coordination_required": [
      {
        "team": "mobile",
        "reason": "API endpoint changed, mobile app needs update",
        "priority": "high"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

#### Deep Mode adds:
- **🏢 Business Impact Assessment**:
  ```json
  {
    "business_risk": "medium",
    "customer_impact": {
      "areas": ["login flow", "authentication"],
      "severity": "medium"
    },
    "compliance_risk": {
      "level": "low",
      "areas": []
    }
  }
  ```

- **📋 Coordination Planning**:
  ```json
  {
    "coordination_required": [...],
    "testing_strategy": {
      "parallel_testing": ["mobile", "frontend"],
      "integration_checkpoints": ["API contracts", "user flows"]
    },
    "communication_plan": {
      "pre_merge": ["Notify teams of API changes"],
      "post_merge": ["Update documentation"]
    }
  }
  ```

### 🛡️ pr_manager Enhancements:

#### Smart Mode:
- **📝 Commit Message Quality Analysis**:
  ```json
  {
    "overall_quality": "good",
    "score": 7.5,
    "issues": ["Some commits lack technical context"],
    "recommendations": ["Add more specific technical details"]
  }
  ```

#### Deep Mode adds:
- **🏢 Business Context Integration**
- **🤝 Stakeholder Impact Mapping**
- **📋 Rollback Strategy Generation**

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Demo Script:
```bash
# LLM-enhanced analysis (default)
python examples/pr_analysis_demo.py

# Interactive mode (choose your level)
python examples/pr_analysis_demo.py interactive
```

### Interactive Mode Example:
```
Enter repository path (default: .): .
Enter source/feature branch: feature/subfeatureB
Enter target branch: main
Enter context branches: feature/subfeatureA,mobile/F1
Safety level (strict/moderate/permissive, default: moderate): moderate
Use LLM enhancement? (y/N, default: N): y

🔍 Analyzing feature/subfeatureB → main...
🧠 Intelligence level: smart
Context branches: feature/subfeatureA,mobile/F1
```

### CLI Usage:
```python
# Fast analysis
git_analyzer(
    base_branch="main",
    feature_branch="feature/subfeatureB",
    compare_branches=["feature/subfeatureA", "mobile/F1"]
)

# Smart analysis with specific model
git_analyzer(
    base_branch="main", 
    feature_branch="feature/subfeatureB",
    compare_branches=["feature/subfeatureA", "mobile/F1"],
    intelligence_level="smart",
    llm_model="gpt-4"
)

# Deep PR validation
pr_manager(
    action="analyze",
    source_branch="feature/subfeatureB",
    target_branch="main",
    context_branches=["feature/subfeatureA", "mobile/F1"],
    intelligence_level="deep",
    safety_level="strict"
)
```
